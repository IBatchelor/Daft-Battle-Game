# Daft-Battle-Game
Attempt to learn Rust by making a daft homage/pastiche to the old Advance Wars games which everyone's probably forgotten about by now - Probably will take a long time/be very stupid

Things need to work out:
Movement over terrain for unit types
Calculating which tiles are possible to travel to
Probably some other stuff
